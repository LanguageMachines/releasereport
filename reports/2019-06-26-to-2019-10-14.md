# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2019-06-26
End date:  2019-10-14

## Short Summary

A major new version of FLAT has been released this period, covering support for annotating arbitrary higher-order
relations. This was an explicit part of the deliverables for T062/T063 and a prerequisite for later implementing
cross-document support (think for instance parallel documents/corpora).

CLAM has had several bugfixes to make the Autosearch forward work in PICCL, as deployed by INT.

A new language identification tool has been written (``colibri-lang``) for Nederlab, with support for two variants of old dutch. This actually brings the total of FoLiA-aware language identification tools to three (``colibri-lang``, ``FoLiA-textcat``, ``folia-langid``), each builds on a different system than the others.

An experimental new FoLiA library for Rust was developed and released, the aim was to see if a high-performance library
could be made with significantly less memory consumption and high speed, which may be useful in the future. The
benchmarks prove succesful.

Talks have been started up regarding participating in federated authentication for our webservices (this was not granted
as part of T018 though, as it was not deemed needed for CLST to be a CLARIN centre?). For proper inclusion in the CLARIN
switchboard, it is relevant again though.

### LaMachine v2.9.0

> * extract list of packages and ask to open installation manifest in editor or not (relates to #63), same thing for the configuration file
> * Removing some packages from the default installation to conserve space:

>   * exclude xgboost from the default installation as it takes up a lot of space and is not a direct dependency
> * add extra user input stage with updated instruction prior to ansible start. This ensures people know to expect a lot of output they can ignore and a long wait whilst things are installing, and so understand what to do when ansible asks for the BECOME password (addressed an issue raised by @pboot)
> * fix for failure to start nginx #151
> * adapting the strict python check and making the bootstrap also work when python 2 is absent in some cases
> * ensured ~/bin is in $PATH immediately after bootstrap
> * added more feedback to lamachine-start-webserver script
> * implemented CSV export ability for lamachine-list
> * do linux distribution detection and warn users if they run on an unsupported or outdated platform
> * [documentation] updated FAQ
