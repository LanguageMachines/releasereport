# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2020-10-14
End date:  2021-01-18

## Short Summary

[Maarten van Gompel]

This period has seen the start of the CLARIAH Interest Groups and various meeting to that end. I am coordinating the
[Text Group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Text), which is probably the most relevant group for WP3, and also co-coordinating the [Workflow group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Workflows/). We also made
a start on [gathering all use-cases centrally](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases) so they are transparent across all
interest groups and work packages.

We got the green light for the [third VRE
plan](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/clariah-plus-tasks/blob/master/di.huc/vre-plan3/plan.pdf) and development on
this is progressing steadily with an initial focus on CLAM and interoperability with the CLARIN Switchboard. Discussions
are starting on how to involve more of Team Text at the Humanities Cluster, as most of the plan was initially written so
a single developer (me) could implement it.

The status of the DeepFrog project is a bit unclear as it was never officially planned/budgetted, and now other
priorities such as the VRE are taking precedence, so it has to be put on hold for the time being. This is a bit of a
shame as there is interest in this also from external parties like Walter Daelemans and Vincent Vandenghinste in the
scope of CLARIAH-VL.

We're giving FoLiA/FLAT/LaMachine support to the [Max Weber
Retrodigitation](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/max-weber.md) project of the Bayerische Akademie
der Wissenschaften, which already led to various improvements and fixes in FLAT (v0.9.3) and the FoLiA ecosystem.

FoLiA v2.4 was released with improved support for modality annotation, and reintroduced external annotation. Version
2.4.2 also implements the ability to use both native and foreign metadata at the same time. For Nederlab, a FoLiA tool
has been implement to split FoLiA documents into smaller parts.

*(deliverable ID: T108D1)*

### folia v2.4.0

> * Added modality annotation (#86) this is now preferred also for sentiment annotation (the dedicated sentiment annotation type is deprecated but remains for backward compatibility) as well as other modalities such as negations, truthfulness, doubt.
> * Added a simple set definition for geolocation and an example to the documentation (using metric annotation)
> * Minor backward-compatibility breaking change: renamed modalityfeature in coreference links to ``mod`` so it doesn't conflict with the new modality element, I've never seen anybody use this aspect of coreference linking in FoLiA yet so it's a small risk I'm taking. Let me know if it causes issues for anybody.
> * Reintroduced and documented External annotation (#87), allowing you to separate child documents from parent documents whilst maintaining links.
