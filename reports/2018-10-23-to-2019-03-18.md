After months of development, FoLiA v2.0 has been released (for details see the release notes later in this report).

Ongoing unreleased work by Ko van der Sloot:

* libfolia
  - een processor class geÃ¯mplementeerd om FoLiA streaming te verwerken

* ucto:
  - gebruikt nu de streaming class van libfolia
  - verschillende issues met folia verwerking gerepareerd
  - grote schoonmaak gehouden in de code

* frog:
 - herimplementatie met een simpelere interne datastructuur
 - voor FoliA verwerking gebruik makend van de libfolia processor class
   daardoor kleinere memory footprint.
 - kleine bug fixes

* ticcltools:
  - nieuwe features gegevoegd tbv TICCL/PICCL/TICCLAT etc

(TODO: Henk?)
Iris Hendrickx worked on:
- Frog evaluation of Ucto, NER, POS, LEM modules

## FoLiA

*Project/task/deliverable references:*  CLARIAH-PLUS WP3 T108; CLARIAH-CORE WP3 T71 [D2.5 (libs); D2.6 (docs); D2.7 (tools)]

### folia 2.0.0

> This is a major new release of FoLiA, which includes some breaking changes such as renamed elements. Nevertheless, the FoLiA libraries retain backward compatibility and can read FoLiA v1 (and v0) documents and upgrade them.
> Points of general interest:
> * Completely revised the FoLiA documentation, turned into more formal specification; automatically drawn from the official specification; with automatically validated examples. Now available as a webpage hosted on https://folia.readthedocs.io (PDF still available too) #43
>   * The documentation includes some guidelines on good FoLiA practises (arose from #70 and others)
> * Added proper support for provenance logging in FoLiA #46
> * Renamed alignment annotation to relation annotation #59
> * Ensured most examples are "sensible" #9
>   * Extended tests using these examples, all examples are automatically tested now
> * The FoLiA tools are now split from the central FoLiA repository into a separate project at https://github.com/proycon/foliatools #55
>   * Cleaner output without stack traces from FoLiA validator #44
> * Implemented the ability to add inline annotations on multi-word spans (group annotations) and solved related multi-word issues. These were previously reserved only for use with structural elements. #51
> * Revised the structure annotation hierarchy (i.e. which structural elements are allowed under which parents) on certain points #42
> * Implemented a hidden words annotation type, allowed a layer of implicit/empty/ghost words that can be referenced from span annotation. Needed e.g. for syntactic movement annotation. #58
> * Allow encoding of soft word breaks / hyphenation #66
> More technical points:
> * Add support for provenance in FQL #60
> * Annotation declaration overhaul and handle missing set attribute in declarations #54
> * Explicitly forbid and prevent forward wrefs from span annotation #41
> * Apply space attribute more generically to multiple structure elements #61
> * Added a new property in the specification to detect tags that may be (or MUST be) used as Wrefs #63
> * Added a new property to distinguish folia:id (IDREF) from xml:id (ID) #64
> * Alias attribute does not propagate to RelaxNG schema yet #65
> A new FoLiA library has been released (replacing the previous one in PyNLPl): https://github.com/proycon/foliapy/releases/tag/2.0.0
> A new version of FoLiA tools has also been released:  https://github.com/proycon/foliatools/releases/tag/2.0.0
> You may also consult the FoLiA release plan (#68) for more information on upgrading and compatibility.


*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2019-03-13)*
https://github.com/proycon/folia/releases/tag/2.0.0

### foliapy 2.0.1

> Allow (limited!) serialisation of older FoLiA versions if ``keepversion`` is set.


*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2019-03-13)*
https://github.com/proycon/foliapy/releases/tag/2.0.1

### foliapy 2.0.0

> Major new release; the former ``pynlpl.formats.folia`` module in PyNLPl has now been migrated to this new standalone package, which constitutes the new FoLiA library for Python. Included is the FoLiA library, FQL library and Set Definition library. This release implements the new FoLiA v2.0, consult the release notes there for a comprehensive list of changes. Library documentation is now hosted on https://foliapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
> Upgrading from pynlpl is usually as easy as doing a ``pip install folia`` and replace within your software: ``from pynlpl.formats import folia`` with ``import folia.main as folia``. The library is backward compatible.


*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2019-03-13)*
https://github.com/proycon/foliapy/releases/tag/2.0.0

### foliatools 2.0.1

> Enable keepversion for certain tools, so they don't upgrade to FoliA v2 if FoLiA v1 input is given, ensuring better backward compatibility.


*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2019-03-13)*
https://github.com/proycon/foliatools/releases/tag/2.0.1

### foliatools v2.0.0

> This is the FoLiA v2 version of the FoLiA-tools, now split from the central FoLiA repository at https://github.com/proycon/folia and building on the new FoLiApy library. New documented resides at https://folia-tools.readthedocs.io/
> * There is a new ``foliaupgrade`` tool to upgrade from FoLiA v1 (or v0) to v2 (although this is usually done implicitly by any of the other tools, or the FoLiAPy library itself, anyway)
> * Refactored the entire foliavalidator
> * Cleaner output without stack traces from FoLiA validator (proycon/folia#44)
> * Added automatic injection of provenance information to various tools

*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2019-01-16)*
https://github.com/LanguageMachines/PICCL/releases/tag/v0.7.3.1

### PICCL v0.7.3

> At least for some PDFs, the PDF to image file convertor in PICCL, i.e. PDFimage, created spurious image files. These sometimes resulted in 'pages' of garbage. Also, when we started building this pipeline, PDFimages did not yet convert straight into tiff-format. So we also used 'convert'.
> Both have now been replaced by pdftoppm, which seems to produce exactly the same amount of output tiff-files as regular PDF viewers report.
