## FoLiA

*Project & Task ID:* [CLARIAH-PLUS WP3 T108](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/clariah-plus-tasks/raw/master/di.huc/FoLiA.T108.pdf)

### folia v2.5.1

> * This release fixes an issue in whitespace handling prior to linebreaks. (#101). Whitespace prior to explicit linebreaks is insignificant.


*([Released](https://github.com/proycon/folia/releases/tag/v2.5.1) by Maarten van Gompel on 2021-08-19)*
https://github.com/proycon/folia/releases/tag/v2.5.1
*(deliverable ID: T108D1)*

### folia v2.5.0

> * The main focus of this release is a reworked and strictly specified whitespace handling. Some changes were already introduced to this end v2.4.1 but these did not solve the problem sufficiently yet. We have now implemented a strict interpretation of whitespace, documented here: https://folia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_annotation.html#whitespace . The new rules are applied to older documents as well so this may lead to different perspective on the text in certain cases, but validators will fall back to the old rules and not cause a hard validation failure if the new rules are not met, preserving backward compatibility.  (#88)
> * Implemented processor tags, a simple tagging mechanism that gives users some handles to convey extra information they want to make available to certain processors. (#93)
> * Added a t-lang element (markup counterpart of the lang element)
