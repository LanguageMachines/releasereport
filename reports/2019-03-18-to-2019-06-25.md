# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2019-03-18
End date:  2019-06-25

## Short Summary

At the end of last period, FoLiA v2 was released, which signified a  major milestone promised for CLARIAH-PLUS that adds
provenance support, rectifies some misnomers from the past, and adheres to a stricter paradigm. This period has seen
development on various tools and libraries, making them compatible with the latest version. We released a FoliA v2
compliant version of libfolia, and of Frog, ucto, and other software relying on libfolia. We also released a new version
of FLAT, which aside from all the FoLiA v2 improvements, now also integrates the new CONLL-U to FoLiA converter,
allowing uploads in this popular format. Moreover, the ReStructuredText to FoLiA converted is also integrated, providing
a good entry point for uploading structured text with markup information.

Certain components that used to be part of PICCL have been split up into seperate projects (without harming the
functionality of PICCL), allowing for better modularity and maintainability. This concerns the [Nederlab
pipeline](https://github.com/proycon/nederlab-pipeline) for linguistic enrichment of historical dutch, and
[aNtiLoPe](https://github.com/proycon/aNtiLoPe), workflows that wrap around Frog and ucto.

Catch-up work has been done for Nederlab, which will eventually also be relevant for CLARIAH-PLUS considering the
follow-up task we were granted. The catch-up work resulted in two new tools that are of more general interest:
* a new TEI to FoLiA converter as part of the folia tools, and is derived from prior work by Jesse de Does (INT).
* [wikiente](https://github.com/proycon/wikiente), a named entity recognition tool and linker, which is a simple but
* fully FoLiA-capable wrapper around DBPedia Spotlight.

Further activities carreid in this period:
*  Metadata mapping SoNaR and CGN (N. Oostdijk); Report to be written
* Application for Knowledge Centre for Atypical Communication further motivated and now approved 
* H. van den Heuvel participated in ParlaFormat (23-24 May), a workshop on TEI-guidelines for parliamentary speech: https://www.clarin.eu/event/2019/parlaformat-workshop
* H. van den Heuvel has been invited for a presentation about secure management of sensitive data at https://www.tapas-etn-eu.org/events/te3
* H. van den Heuvel was involved in preparations for DH2019 workshop on Transcription Chain: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dh2019-workshop-the-case-of-interview-data-tickets-59161515686 
* I. Hendrickx worked on Experiments &  bug testing  of frog modules, mainly  morphological analysis

> * Allow unsetting flaturl in external yaml configuration to disable flat viewers (proycon/clam#75)
> * Propagate existing input textclass option to PICCL and assume a default of 'current' (rather than 'OCR') if OCR is skipped (#48) and change TICCL inputclass default to 'current' instead of 'OCR' when dealing with FoLiA input
> *  Delete zero byte input files prior to FoLiA-correct (artefact of earlier patchy error ignore strategy) #49
