# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2021-01-19
End date:  2021-04-06

## Short Summary

One of the main things I have been working on the past period is the VRE task. There's been significant work on CLAM and
LaMachine to implement the functionality promised in the VRE plan. All of this is still in development pending release
so not included in this report yet. The actual status for these VRE milestones can be tracked here:

 * T137M1 - CLAM - https://github.com/proycon/clam/milestone/11
 * T137M2 - LaMachine - https://github.com/proycon/clam/milestone/11
 * T137M3 - FLAT - https://github.com/proycon/flat/milestone/17

A major point that I added to the VRE plan was to finally finish the proper federated authentication solution (using
OpenID Connect). This has been promised for years but now I moved to KNAW I finally have access to the relevant
authentication infrastructure and contact with the maintainers thereof to finally realize this plan. It did take up a
considerable portion of the VRE time. The existing plan is well on track but will need to be stretched over
the entire year as I have some other priorities coming up that will hinder my ability to work on this for some months.

Right now the VRE execution is still a one-man effort but I had productive discussions with Hennie Brugman (KNAW HuC)
and Hayco de Jong, albeit after a long delay, on what their team can contribute to the VRE plan. Rather than delegate a
portion of the existing plan, we think it would be better to take the opportunity to integrate further tools their Team
Text is working on, the first focus being on [TextRepo](https://github.com/knaw-huc/textrepo). A clear plan on how to
proceed with HuC's Team Text still has to be formulated.

I spoke with Jan, Gijsbert and Daan about partially succeeding Daan as technical coordinator for WP3, as he left us per
April first. I volunteered because of the overlap with the things I'm already doing in the Interest Groups and Technical
Committee.

I have spent a lot of time on work surrounding the Interest Groups and Technical Committee, most notably on coordinating
the collection of the use cases (see https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases ) and setting up guidelines for the interest
groups as a whole. The actual interest groups I coordinate (Text Processing & Workflows) haven't really seen much member
activity yet. I've been in contact with Roeland (who's succeeding GertJan as CTO) and with Susanne as a programme
coordinator.  Getting people to actually participate in the interest groups and in submitting use cases proves to be a
great deal more challenging than I anticipated. We do have a decent foundation of use cases now. For WP3 we have use
cases from DANS (1), INT (covering mostly WP6), RUN and KNAW (the latter consisting of my own contributions). UU and MPI
have not submitted anything yet (neither have VU and RUG, but I don't think they have a formal role in WP3 nowadays?).
FA expressed interest and is probably still deliberating.

A major new FoLiA release (v2.5) is also pending and will soon be published. It strictly specifies the role of
whitespace in FoLiA and solves all kind of issues that arose in that regard.  Most of this work was prompted by the use
case [Retrodigitization of Text-critical Editions](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/max-weber.md) (Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften),
which I'm providing support for in the scope of my CLARIAH FoLiA & FLAT maintenance and support tasks.

Susanne and I compiled an overview of my tasks and their status, I'll keep that one up to date here:
https://github.com/LanguageMachines/clariah-plus-tasks/blob/master/clariah-plus-workplan.fods

My time is getting a bit fragmented over all the various tasks, especially considering there are also big non-CLARIAH tasks that
I'm also participating  and also due to the large increase in overhead because of the Interest Groups,
Technical Committee and soon possibly also WP3 Technical Coordination.

> * added resources (migrated from inl/nederlab-linguistic-enrichment)
> * only do language identification on sentences!
> * simplifying the pipeline, do not run frog in batches anymore but one frog per file (at cost of init time and extra memory, but easier to handle potential errors)
> * replacing folialangid with colibri-lang, use --subcodes for colibri-lang
> * do language detection before tokenization
