# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2020-06-03
End date:  2020-10-13

## Short Summary

At the beginning of this period, Maarten van Gompel moved from CLST, Radboud University Nijmegen to DI, Humanities
Cluster, KNAW for 0,6 fte. This means the CLARIAH WP3 tasks under his lead are moved as well. A permanent position at
CLST for 0,2 fte is retained for system administration, which focusses on guaranteeing the hosting at CLST of numerous
CLARIAH services.

Notable developments:

* Contributed to the start-up of the CLARIAH Interest groups
* Released FoLiA v2.3.0 which supports a new explicit form of XML serialisation
* The tei2folia converter has been extended to support more of TEI
* Deepfrog: first experimental release; featuring transformer-based neural models for PoS, NER and lemmatisation
* LaMachine updates: integrating more software in collaboration with Stichting Open Spraaktechnologie also added deepfrog,
  significant refactoring and fixes.

I redefined the [task plans](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/clariah-plus-tasks/tree/master/di.huc) as requested,
defining more deliverables and milestones. The plans themselves also give an indication of progress. I'm trying to get
the plans better aligned with the actual reality. Some remarks/concerns:

* Most of the tasks are maintenance & support tasks, intended to run for the entire duration of CLARIAH to ensure users of the
    software are ensured of support and fixes.
* The current time allocation does not neatly align with contract situation; all time allocations were condensed and HuC contract runs out long before the end of CLARIAH-PLUS, whilst the original idea
  was for these maintenance & support tasks to be stretched out over the full project duration.
* Because of the rolling nature of the tasks, defining milestones ahead of time is often not possible.
* The LaMachine task was formally allocated far too little time and exceeds this.
* DeepFrog was not planned initially but is a logical continuation of Frog. Its conception was supported by Henk and
  Antal; I moved it under T139 (Frog). However, time is not formally allocated for this.

### clamservices v2.2.2

*([Released](https://github.com/proycon/clamservices/releases/tag/v2.2.2) by Maarten van Gompel on 2020-10-01)*
https://github.com/proycon/clamservices/releases/tag/v2.2.2


## FLAT

*Project & Task ID:* [CLARIAH-PLUS WP3 T062](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/clariah-plus-tasks/raw/master/di.huc/FLAT.T062.pdf)

### foliadocserve v0.7.3

## FoLiA

*Project & Task ID:* [CLARIAH-PLUS WP3 T108](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/clariah-plus-tasks/raw/master/di.huc/FoLiA.T108.pdf)

### folia v2.3.0

> * Added the possibility of serialising FoLiA to *explicit form*. Explicit form is a more verbose XML serialisation that makes assumptions that are usually implicit in FoLiA (such as defaults and element categories) explicit in the output. This facilitates the job for parsers who do not implement the full FoLiA logic. This is meant to be used as an alternative serialisation only in cases where it makes sense (to support such 3rd party parsers). #84
> * Documentation and README updates:
>   * added the new rust library, amended implementation list
> * Added new examples and fixed some existing examples
> * Some added flexibility in certain nested of structural elements;
>   * allow Word directly under Division
>   * allow Linebreaks in tables, figures and lists (outside of items, rows/cells), because these are sometimes used to denote pagebreaks in multi-span tables/figures/lists.

*(deliverable ID: T108D5)*

### folia-rust v0.0.3

> This release adds some essential features to the API:
> * Implemented a high-level annotate() method analogous to foliapy's add() method. Handles span annotation transparently.
> * implemented common_ancestors()
> * implemented get_layer_key()
> * make sure layers reverse-inherit their set from their children
> * finished provenance support, an active processor can now be associated with a document
> * datetime attributes are now chrono::NaiveDateTime structs and properly parsed, rather than a plain String

### foliatools v2.3.1

> Bugfix release:
> * [txt2folia] Prevent adding empty text content (#14)


*([Released](https://github.com/proycon/foliatools/releases/tag/v2.3.1) by Maarten van Gompel on 2020-09-11)*
https://github.com/proycon/foliatools/releases/tag/v2.3.1
*(deliverable ID: T108D6)*

### foliatools v2.3.0

> * The **tei2folia** converter has been extended to support more of TEI
>    * Implements conversion of tokens, sentences and simple linguistic annotation (@pos,@lemma,@join,@msd) (#12 #13)
>    * better document ID detection, prefer DOI, then ISSN, then ISBN, then DTADirName (specific to Deutsches Text Archiv), fall back to untyped but check we get something sane out of it. #12
>    *  implemented conversion of @norm attribute (not sure if this is entirely according to TEI P5 spec but Deutsches Text Archiv uses it.
>    * Benefit from  some of the newly allowed structural nestings in folia v2.3
>    * Implemented handling for tei:trailer and some other elements
>    * Ignore styling that is wrapped around structural elements (for now)
>    * Added extra sanity checks
> * foliavalidator now implements the ability to output to **explicit form** (proycon/folia#84). Explicit form is a more verbose XML serialisation that makes assumptions that are usually implicit in FoLiA (such as defaults and element categories) explicit in the output. This facilitates the job for parsers who do not implement the full FoLiA logic. This is meant to be used as an alternative serialisation only in cases where it makes sense (to support such 3rd party parsers).
> * Various fixes for ``foliatextcontent``
> * implemented a first version of a FoLiA to Salt converetor (proycon/folia#85). This is still in an experimental stage. Salt is a graph based model that acts as an intermediate model in their conversion tool Pepper. This folia2salt convertor in combination with pepper allows users, in theory, to convert FoLiA to formats such as TCF, Paula XML, ANNIS and many others.
> * Updated documentation with some more in-depth sections on foliavalidator, tei2folia and folia2salt
> * various foliaspec updates
