# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2020-01-15
End date:  2020-06-02

## Short Summary

This period ends with the retirement of Ko van Sloot. We worked on releasing the latests versions of his software (Frog,
ucto, timbl, mbt, libfolia) and also built and submitted new debian packages for all of these, having reached a stable
and mature state. Maintenance of Frog, Timbl, mbt, libfolia will be taken over by Maarten van Gompel, ensuring
continuity, albeit with much reduced focus on further development of new features in these software packages.

The TICCL-tools have been released as well, along with a new release of PICCL. As there is no maintainer for TICCL-tools
after Ko's retirement, development and maintenance on this will most likely come to a stop until Martin Reynaert can
find a successor.

A summary of other news:

* [Maarten van Gompel]
  * Started work on DeepFrog, an intended successor for Frog powered by state-of-the-art deep-learning transformers.
  * Contributed directly to the CLARIN LR switchboard by implementing a FoLiA profiler.
  * Several improvements/fixes were made to CLAM.
  * Attended the CLARIAH AAI-Support call with DAASI
  * Attended the CLARIAH Technical Committee meeting
  * Finally got his PhD ;)
